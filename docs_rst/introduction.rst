Introduction of VISE.
=====================

First-principles calculations are becoming increasingly prevalent in materials science.
However, preparing input files for the calculations and analyzing calculation results are
still not an easy task for researchers other than experienced ones.
To overcome the situation, we have developed **vise** code, which means *vasp integrate simulation environment*.
vise supports VASP users to generate VASP input files for several tasks with suitable defaults,
and allows the users to tune some parameters depending on their particular purposes.

**Note: Units used in pydefect are eV for energy and angstrom for length following the vasp convention.**
